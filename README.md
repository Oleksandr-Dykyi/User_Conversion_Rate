## User_Conversion_Rate

#### Technology Stack:
Tableau (calculated fields, function, parameters, actions, dashboard creation)

#### Project Description:
In this Tableau project, I leveraged Tableau to analyze user conversion rates.

Using the provided dataset, I designed a comprehensive dashboard featuring the following components:

Three Number Blocks: These displayed the counts of registered users, users who initiated the trial period, and users who made payments. The conversion rate from registration to each corresponding step was conveniently displayed in tooltips.

Registration and Conversion Graph: I created a graph illustrating the number of registrations and the conversion rate from registration to the trial period for each month of registration.

Average Time to Payment Schedule: A dynamic schedule presented the average number of days from registration to payment for each month of registration.

Funnel Diagram: I designed a funnel-shaped diagram that visually depicted user progression through each step of the conversion process. The chart provided data in both absolute numbers (representing the number of users completing each step) and relative percentages (indicating the conversion rate).

To enhance interactivity, I incorporated Actions and Parameters into the dashboard with the following configurations:

Clicking on the block displaying the number of users who initiated the trial period triggered a transformation in Chart #3, revealing the average number of days before the trial.
Clicking on the block indicating the number of users who completed payments triggered another transformation in Chart #3, displaying the average number of days until payment.
